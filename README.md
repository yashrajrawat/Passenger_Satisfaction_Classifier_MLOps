# Passenger_Satisfaction_Classifier_MLOps

Airline Passenger Satisfaction 
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting passenger satisfaction levels for airlines using a comprehensive dataset derived from a passenger satisfaction survey. The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and adheres to best practices in MLOps to ensure reliability, scalability, and reproducibility.

# Project Overview

Context
Airline passenger satisfaction is a crucial metric for improving customer experience and operational efficiency. This project aims to:
  1. Identify factors highly correlated with passenger satisfaction.
  2. Develop a robust classification model to predict passenger satisfaction levels.
  3. Implement the solution within an MLOps framework to streamline deployment and monitoring.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on various aspects of the airline experience, including demographic, travel-related, and satisfaction-related features. Key features include:
Demographics: Gender, Age, Customer Type.
Travel Details: Type of Travel, Class, Flight Distance.
Satisfaction Metrics: Ratings (1-5 scale) for inflight services, seat comfort, entertainment, cleanliness, and more.
Delays: Departure and Arrival Delay in minutes.
Target Variable: Satisfaction (Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied).
